## Recent Learnings

- **Realtime timeout false empties** -> Drive both watchdog extension and `_check_no_response()` from the same raw downstream activity signal (`TTSAudioRawFrame`, `TTSTextFrame`, `LLMTextFrame`, and bot speaking frames), not just coarse TTS/bot state -> Prevents `[EMPTY_RESPONSE]` retries when output is already in flight but state bookkeeping lags under load.
- **Rehydrated review context drift** -> Show prior turns from benchmark gold history, including `required_function_call` and `function_call_response`, rather than prior model outputs -> Keeps review context aligned with single-step rehydration semantics and avoids misleading failure analysis.
- **Review artifact mode mismatch** -> Treat single-run review folders and multi-model comparison folders as separate load modes in the Streamlit app, with explicit detection from `review_payload.json` vs `metadata.json` + `run_results.csv` -> Prevents aggregate comparison outputs from breaking the single-run drilldown UI.
- **Deep error analysis source of truth** -> Derive model error modes from `openai_judged.jsonl` turn rows plus `judge_reasoning`, `tool_calls`, and `tool_results`, not from aggregate score tables alone -> Preserves the actual failure mechanism and supports model-specific clustering.
