"""
Personal assistant conversation benchmark turns (31 turns: 0-30).

Scenario: Dana Fischer calls Atlas Personal Assistant to handle multiple
tasks in a single session. She needs to book a flight to NYC for a work
meeting, send emails to colleagues, book a hotel, set reminders, and add
calendar events. 

Scoring dimensions:
  Core (every turn):
  - KB:        KB / factual grounding
  - Instr:     Instruction following
  - Tool:      Tool-use correctness
  Conditional (added per-category):
  - State:     State tracking across turns
  - Ambiguity: Ambiguity handling (entities, numbers, context)

Usage:
